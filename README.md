`tween` is an std-optional tweening library, designed for use in games and animations.

## Quick Start

To install, add the following to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
tween = "2.1.0"
```

You can make a Tweener, like this:

```rust
use tween::Tweener;

let (start, end) = (0, 100);
let duration = 15.0;

let mut tweener = Tweener::sine_in_out(start, end, duration);
let mut position = 0;

const DT: f32 = 1.0 / 60.0;

// and then in your main loop...
loop {
    position = tweener.move_by(DT);
    if tweener.is_finished() {
        break;
    }
}

assert_eq!(position, 100, "we've moved to the end of the tween");
```

## Overview

A `Tween` is a function which returns values from one specified number to another specified number over a specified amount of time. The simplest `Tween` which everyone is familiar with is `lerp`, or "linear interpolation". In this library, it is called `Linear` -- a Linear Tween moves from its start to its end by the formula `start * (1.0 - p) + end * p`, where `p` is the percent over time you are into the tween. So at time `0`, or `0%`, you end up with the `start` value, and at time `1`, or `100%`, you end up with the end value.

There are many kinds of Tweens beyond Linear, of course; all of which can produce feel and animations! We often use tweens to move positions of objects in games, but you can use Tweens for animating a sprite, selecting behavior, audio manipulation, or even drawing fonts with Cubic Bezier Tweens.

This library gives you access to all the tweens initially made by Robert Penner -- you can see them in action [here](https://easings.net/).

This library exposes three kinds of structs:

- Zero-Sized Tweens which implement the `Tween` trait. They also expose the method `tween` inherently, so you can tween easily with them, like `tween::Linear.tween`.
- Wrapper Tweens which implement the `Tween` trait. These are `Looper`, `Oscillator` and `Extrapolator`. These all wrap *around* other Tweens. See their documentation for more information.
- `Tweener` and `FixedTweener`, both of which "drive" a `Tween`. You should use `FixedTweener` in a fixed timestep application; otherwise, use `Tweener`. Although you can use a `Tween` directly, a `Tweener` manages all the Tween state for you.

For 99% of users, you'll want to construct `Tweener`s or `FixedTweener`s with a Tween for this library, occasionally looping or oscillating them.

## Making Tweens Yourself

If you'd like to make your own tween, you absolutely can! For that, you'll need to see the main trait of this library: `Tween`. You can prototype your own `Tween` implementations with a simple closure, since `FnMut(value_delta: Value, percent: f32) -> Value` implements `Tween`, or just use that yourself. Closures are very nice because you can add, or even composite, tweens in interesting ways.

For example, here's a `Linear` tween averaged with a `SineIn` tween:

```rust
use tween::{Tweener, SineIn, Linear};

Tweener::new(0.0, 10.0, 10, |value_delta, percent| {
    (Linear.tween(value_delta, percent) + SineIn.tween(value_delta, percent)) / 2.0
});
```

To see a documented example of a Cubic Bezier Tween, see `examples/cubic_bezier.rs`.

## Storing Tweens

Very often in a game or animation engine, you'll want to store Tweens by what they act *on*, without caring about what kind of Tween example it is. To do that, you'll want to box the Tween within the Tweener. Since all the Tweens in this library are ZSTs, the Box won't actually allocate, though you will have to use dynamic access (which will be more than fast enough).

```rust no_run
use tween::{Tweener, Looper, Linear, SineIn, Tween};

// very often game engines need sync/sync
type SendSyncTween<Value, Time> = Tweener<Value, Time, Box<dyn Tween<Value> + Send + Sync>>;

let mut my_tweener: SendSyncTween<i32, i32> = Tweener::new(0, 100, 100, Box::new(Linear));
let mut going_up = true;

// we lerp from 0 to 100 over 100 frames, and then we flip our tween back
// into a SineIn tween over 10 frames, so this looks like a slowwwwwww buildup
// and then a SHARP drop down.
//
// we put this in a thread here to demonstrate `Send + Sync`
std::thread::spawn(move || {
    loop {
        let _output_assigned_somewhere = my_tweener.move_by(1);
        if my_tweener.is_finished() {
            my_tweener = if going_up {
                Tweener::new(100, 0, 10, Box::new(SineIn))
            } else {
                Tweener::new(0, 100, 100, Box::new(Linear))
            };
            going_up = !going_up;
        }
    }
});
```

## Implementing `TweenValue`

This library uses two traits: `TweenTime` and `TweenValue`. You can implement these yourself, but implementing `TweenTime` would only have fairly obscure uses.

On the other hand, `TweenValue` needs to be implemented for any tweenable value. By default, all numerical types are already implemented in this library. Additionally, several math libs have a feature flag (see below) which gates an implementation for their structs as appropriate.

## Going Fast ⚡️

This library is, ultimately, a math library, and benefits enormously from being in release mode.

## Features

`tween` has the following features:

- `std`: **enabled by default**, gives access to faster floating point math and helper methods with `Box`
- `libm`: enable this, without default features, for no-std tweening
- `glam`: enable this for `glam` types to implement `TweenValue`
- `nalgebra`: enable this for `nalgebra` types to implement `TweenValue`

## Std Optional

This library uses `std` with the default feature `std`. Disable default features, and enable `libm`, for a no-std experience. (We need to use `libm` for the floating point math), like so:

```toml
tween = { verison = "2.1.0", default_features = false, features = ["libm"] }
```

## MSRV and Safety

This crate has no MSRV yet. If it sees good adoption, an MSRV policy will be decided.

Additionally, this crate is `#![deny(unsafe_code)]`, since no unsafe code was needed. Changing this policy would constitute a minor breaking change.

## Breaking Changes

This crate follows normal rules for breaking changes **except for math libraries besides `glam`.** We make no promises that we'll update perfectly with math libraries -- you are encouraged to make forks of this repo instead if you have version handling requirements.

## Roadmap

Next up for this library is handling Splines of Tweeners.
