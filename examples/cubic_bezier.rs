//! In this example, we implement a Cubic Bezier function as a tween.
//!
//! We do it two ways -- first as a closure, which we pass around unnamed (which means,
//! of course, we can't store it in a struct), and then as a struct with an implementation.
//! For fun, that second implementation also overrides `is_finite`, producing a Bezier Tween
//! which goes...on and on...and on! You probably would never want to do that directly on a Tween
//! which isn't about "looping" (for that use `Looper` or `Oscillator`). Instead, if you actually
//! wanted that, leave the default implementation and then wrap our `CubicBezier` in `Extrapolator`
//! when you want to extrapolate.

    // so it wouldn't matter, but if we weren't tweening off the origin, it would be
    // very important!
